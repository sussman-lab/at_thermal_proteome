	abstract = {Isobaric mass tagging (e.g., TMT and iTRAQ) is a precise and sensitive multiplexed peptide/protein quantification technique in mass spectrometry. However, accurate quantification of complex proteomic samples is impaired by cofragmentation of peptides, leading to systematic underestimation of quantitative ratios. Label-free quantification strategies do not suffer from such an accuracy bias but cannot be multiplexed and are less precise. Here, we compared protein quantification results obtained with these methods for a chemoproteomic competition binding experiment and evaluated the utility of measures of spectrum purity in survey spectra for estimating the impact of cofragmentation on measured TMT-ratios. While applying stringent interference filters enables substantially more accurate TMT quantification, this came at the expense of 30\%?60\% fewer proteins quantified. We devised an algorithm that corrects experimental TMT ratios on the basis of determined peptide interference levels. The quantification accuracy achieved with this correction was comparable to that obtained with stringent spectrum filters but limited the loss in coverage to {\textless}10\%. The generic applicability of the fold change correction algorithm was further demonstrated by spiking of chemoproteomics samples into excess amounts of E. coli tryptic digests.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.
Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.

	abstract = {The thermal stability of proteins can be used to assess ligand binding in living cells. We have generalized this concept by determining the thermal profiles of more than 7000 proteins in human cells by means of mass spectrometry. Monitoring the effects of small-molecule ligands on the profiles delineated more than 50 targets for the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase as a target of kinase inhibitors and suggest that its inhibition causes the phototoxicity observed with vemurafenib and alectinib. Thermal shifts were also observed for downstream effectors of drug treatment. In live cells, dasatinib induced shifts in BCR-ABL pathway proteins, including CRK/CRKL. Thermal proteome profiling provides an unbiased measure of drug-target engagement and facilitates identification of markers for drug efficacy and toxicity.
INTRODUCTION Understanding drug mechanism poses the daunting challenge of determining the affinity of the drug for all potential targets. Drug target engagement can be assessed by means of a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) based on ligand-induced changes in protein thermal stability. We combined the CETSA method with quantitative mass spectrometry to study the effect of drugs on the thermal profile of a cellular proteome comprising more than 7000 proteins. The approach enabled the monitoring of drug targets and downstream effectors.
Tracking drugs in living cells. Drugs alter the thermal stability of proteins directly through compound binding or indirectly through changes in overall protein state. Thermal proteome profiling determines melting curves for thousands of proteins and tracks drug action in cells.
RATIONALE We devised a method for the thermal profiling of cellular proteomes. Cells were cultured with or without drugs and heated to different temperatures so as to induce protein denaturation, and remaining soluble proteins were extracted with buffer. At each temperature, soluble proteins were quantified by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry, yielding denaturation curves. This allowed determination of thermal stability and the identification of ligand-induced shifts. To rank binding affinities among multiple targets, we determined stability profiles across a range of compound concentrations at a defined temperature. Comparison of the thermal profiles obtained after drug treatment of intact cells versus cell extract allowed us to distinguish effects induced by ligand binding from those induced by downstream modifications.
RESULTS We performed thermal proteome profiling (TPP) on human K562 cells by heating intact cells or cell extracts and observed marked differences in melting properties between the two settings, with a trend toward increased protein stability in cell extract. Adenosine triphosphatase (ATP)–binding proteins showed a significant trend toward increased stability in intact cells, suggesting stabilization by the endogenous ligand. This was confirmed with the addition of ATP to cell extract, which resulted in increased stability for this protein group. The ability of TPP to identify target binding was validated by using the broad-specificity inhibitors staurosporine and GSK3182571, which induced shifts in the melting temperatures of many kinase targets and also affected the thermal profiles of other proteins, including regulatory subunits of kinase complexes. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase (FECH) as an off-target of several kinase inhibitors and showed that the drug vemurafenib reaches full target occupancy of its cognate target BRAF and the off-target FECH within a narrow concentration window. FECH deficiency is genetically linked to protoporphyria, suggesting that the photosensitivity induced by vemurafenib and other drugs is mediated by FECH. Drug treatment of live cells affected not only direct target proteins but also downstream effectors. The ABL inhibitor dasatinib induced thermal shifts in several proteins downstream of BCR-ABL, including CRKL, and at concentrations in good agreement with the effect on cell growth.
CONCLUSION Thermal profiling of cellular proteomes enables the differential assessment of protein ligand binding and other protein modifications, providing an unbiased measure of drug-target occupancy for multiple targets and facilitating the identification of markers for drug efficacy and toxicity.
Mapping human drug targets in the cell
To understand both the beneficial and the side effects of a drug, one would need to know its full binding profile to all cellular proteins. Savitski et al. take significant steps toward meeting this daunting challenge. They monitored the unfolding or “melting” of over 7000 human proteins and measured how small-molecule binding changes individual melting profiles. As a proof of principle, over 50 targets were identified for an inhibitor known to bind a broad spectrum of kinases. Two cancer drugs, vemurafib and Alectinib, are known to have a side effect of photosensitivity. The thermal profiling approach identified drug-protein interactions responsible for these side effects.

Despite the significant efforts of the last decades, faster and more accurate stability predictors on the proteomic-wide scale are currently demanded. The determination and control of protein stability are indeed fundamental steps on the path towards de novo design. In this paper we develop a method for predicting the stability curve of proteins. This curve encodes the temperature dependence of the folding free energy (). Its knowledge is important in the study of protein stability since all the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the folding transition can be extracted from it. Our prediction method is based on temperature-dependent mean force potentials and uses the tertiary structure of the target protein as well as the melting temperature () and the heat capacity change () of some other proteins belonging to the same family. From the predicted stability curves, the , the and the at room temperature can be inferred. The predictions obtained are compared with experimental data and show reasonable performances.},

This knowledge would be particularly relevant for engineering thermostable enzymes. In several experimental approaches, this issue has been serendipitously addressed. It would be therefore convenient providing a computational method that predicts when a given protein mutant is more thermostable than its corresponding wild-type.
Results: We present a new method based on support vector machines that is able to predict whether a set of mutations (including insertion and deletions) can enhance the thermostability of a given protein sequence. When trained and tested on a redundancy-reduced dataset, our predictor achieves 88\% accuracy and a correlation coefficient equal to 0.75. Our predictor also correctly classifies 12 out of 14 experimentally characterized protein mutants with enhanced thermostability. Finally, it correctly detects all the 11 mutated proteins whose increase in stability temperature is {\textgreater}10°C.

A 2.8 angstrom difference Fourier map reveals two metal ions at the active site, one persistently bound and the other possibly exchangeable during RNA synthesis.

Here we present a statistical examination of structural and sequence parameters in representatives of 18 non-redundant families of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins. Our aim was to look for systematic differences among thermophilic and mesophilic proteins across the families. We observe that both thermophilic and mesophilic proteins have similar hydrophobicities, compactness, oligomeric states, polar and non-polar contribution to surface areas, main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonds. Insertions/deletions and proline substitutions do not show consistent trends between the thermophilic and mesophilic members of the families. On the other hand, salt bridges and side chain–side chain hydrogen bonds increase in the majority of the thermophilic proteins. Additionally, comparisons of the sequences of the thermophile–mesophile homologous protein pairs indicate that Arg and Tyr are significantly more frequent, while Cys and Ser are less frequent in thermophilic proteins. Thermophiles both have a larger fraction of their residues in the α-helical conformation, and they avoid Pro in their α-helices to a greater extent than the mesophiles. These results indicate that thermostable proteins adapt dual strategies to withstand high temperatures. Our intention has been to explore factors contributing to the stability of proteins from thermophiles with respect to the melting temperatures (Tm), the best descriptor of thermal stability. Unfortunately, Tm values are available only for a few proteins in our high resolution dataset. Currently, this limits our ability to examine correlations in a meaningful way.},

We compared a set of 12 genomes (from four thermophilic archaeons, one eukaryote, six mesophilic eubacteria, and one thermophilic eubacteria). Our results showed that thermophiles have a greater content of charged residues than mesophiles, both at the overall genomic level and in alpha helices. Furthermore, we found that in thermophiles the charged residues in helices tend to be preferentially arranged with a 1-4 helical spacing and oriented so that intra-helical charge pairs agree with the helix dipole. Collectively, these results imply that intra-helical salt bridges are more prevalent in thermophiles than mesophiles and thus suggest that they are an important factor stabilizing thermophilic proteins. We also found that the proteins in thermophiles appear to be somewhat shorter than those in mesophiles. However, this later observation may have more to do with evolutionary relationships than with physically stabilizing factors. In all our statistics we were careful to controls for various biases. These could have, for instance, arisen due to repetitive or duplicated sequences. In particular, we repeated our calculation using a variety of random and directed sampling schemes. One of these involved making a "stratified sample," a representative cross-section of the genomes derived from a set of 52 orthologous proteins present roughly once in each genome. For another sample, we focused on the subset of the 52 orthologs that had a known 3D structure. This allowed us to determine the frequency of tertiary as well as main-chain salt bridges. Our statistical controls supported our overall conclusion about the prevalence of salt bridges in thermophiles in comparison to mesophiles.},

Most of the comparative studies have focused on thermal stability and show, as expected, that thermophilic proteins have higher Tm values than their mesophilic counterparts. Although these comparisons are useful, more detailed thermodynamic analyses are required to reach a more complete understanding of the mechanisms thermophilic protein employ to remain folded over a wider range of temperatures. This complete thermodynamic description allows one to generate a stability curve for a protein that defines how the conformational stability (ΔG) varies with temperature. Here we compare stability curves for many pairs of homologous proteins from thermophilic and mesophilc organisms. Of the basic methods that can be employed to achieve enhanced thermostability, we find that most thermophilic proteins use the simple method that raises the ΔG at all temperatures as the principal way to increase their Tm. We discuss and compare this thermodynamic method with the possible alternatives. In addition we propose ways that structural alterations and changes to the amino acid sequences might give rise to varied methods used to obtain thermostability.},

The first mechanism is “structure-based,” whereby some hyperthermostable proteins are significantly more compact than their mesophilic homologues, while no particular interaction type appears to cause stabilization; rather, a sheer number of interactions is responsible for thermostability. Other hyperthermostable proteins employ an alternative, “sequence-based” mechanism of their thermal stabilization. They do not show pronounced structural differences from mesophilic homologues. Rather, a small number of apparently strong interactions is responsible for high thermal stability of these proteins. High-throughput comparative analysis of structures and complete genomes of several hyperthermophilic archaea and bacteria revealed that organisms develop diverse strategies of thermophilic adaptation by using, to a varying degree, two fundamental physical mechanisms of thermostability. The choice of a particular strategy depends on the evolutionary history of an organism. Proteins from organisms that originated in an extreme environment, such as hyperthermophilic archaea (Pyrococcus furiosus), are significantly more compact and more hydrophobic than their mesophilic counterparts. Alternatively, organisms that evolved as mesophiles but later recolonized a hot environment (Thermotoga maritima) relied in their evolutionary strategy of thermophilic adaptation on “sequence-based” mechanism of thermostability. We propose an evolutionary explanation of these differences based on physical concepts of protein designability.},

One way to approach this question is to compare homologous sites in proteins from one thermophile and a closely related mesophile; asymmetrical substitution patterns have been taken as evidence for selection favoring certain amino acids over others. However, most pairs of prokaryotic species that differ in optimum temperature also differ in genome-wide GC content, and amino acid content is known to be associated with GC content. Here, I compare homologous sites in nine thermophilic prokaryotes and their mesophilic relatives, all with complete published genome sequences. After adjusting for the effects of differing GC content with logistic regression, 139 of the 190 pairs of amino acids show significant substitutional asymmetry, evidence of widespread adaptive amino acid substitution. The patterns are fairly consistent across the nine pairs of species (after taking the effects of differing GC content into account), suggesting that much of the asymmetry results from adaptation to temperature. Some amino acids in some species pairs deviate from the overall pattern in ways indicating that adaptation to other environmental or physiological differences between the species may also play a role. The property that is best correlated with the patterns of substitutional asymmetry is transfer free energy, a measure of hydrophobicity, with more hydrophobic amino acids favored at higher temperatures. The correlation of asymmetry and hydrophobicity is fairly weak, suggesting that other properties may also be important.},

The present study is the first to report a rapid method for predicting Tm (melting temperature), the temperature at which 50\% of the protein is unfolded, directly from protein sequences (the Tm Index program is available at http://tm.life.nthu.edu.tw/). We examined 75 complete microbial genomes using the Tm Index, and the analysis clearly differentiated hyperthermophilic from mesophilic microorganisms on this global genomic basis. These results are consistent with the previous hypothesis that hyperthermophiles express a greater number of high Tm proteins compared with mesophiles. The Tm Index will be valuable for modifying existing proteins (enzymes, protein drugs and vaccines) or designing novel proteins having a desired melting temperature.},

	abstract = {Background
     There is a considerable literature on the source of the thermostability of proteins from thermophilic organisms. Understanding the mechanisms for this thermostability would provide insights into proteins generally and permit the design of synthetic hyperstable biocatalysts.

Results
     We have systematically tested a large number of sequence and structure derived quantities for their ability to discriminate thermostable proteins from their non-thermostable orthologs using sets of mesophile-thermophile ortholog pairs. Most of the quantities tested correspond to properties previously reported to be associated with thermostability. Many of the structure related properties were derived from the Delaunay tessellation of protein structures.

Conclusions
     Carefully selected sequence based indices discriminate better than purely structure based indices. Combined sequence and structure based indices improve performance somewhat further. Based on our analysis, the strongest contributors to thermostability are an increase in ion pairs on the protein surface and a more strongly hydrophobic interior.},

	abstract = {There have been considerable attempts in the past to relate phenotypic trait—habitat temperature of organisms—to their genotypes, most importantly compositions of their genomes and proteomes. However, despite accumulation of anecdotal evidence, an exact and conclusive relationship between the former and the latter has been elusive. We present an exhaustive study of the relationship between amino acid composition of proteomes, nucleotide composition of DNA, and optimal growth temperature (OGT) of prokaryotes. Based on 204 complete proteomes of archaea and bacteria spanning the temperature range from −10 °C to 110 °C, we performed an exhaustive enumeration of all possible sets of amino acids and found a set of amino acids whose total fraction in a proteome is correlated, to a remarkable extent, with the OGT. The universal set is Ile, Val, Tyr, Trp, Arg, Glu, Leu (IVYWREL), and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93. We also found that the G + C content in 204 complete genomes does not exhibit a significant correlation with OGT (R = −0.10). On the other hand, the fraction of A + G in coding DNA is correlated with temperature, to a considerable extent, due to codon patterns of IVYWREL amino acids. Further, we found strong and independent correlation between OGT and the frequency with which pairs of A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences. This adaptation is achieved via codon bias. These findings present a direct link between principles of proteins structure and stability and evolutionary mechanisms of thermophylic adaptation. On the nucleotide level, the analysis provides an example of how nature utilizes codon bias for evolutionary adaptation to extreme conditions. Together these results provide a complete picture of how compositions of proteomes and genomes in prokaryotes adjust to the extreme conditions of the environment.},

	abstract = {Although protein expression is regulated both temporally and spatially, most proteins have an intrinsic, “typical” range of functionally effective abundance levels. These extend from a few molecules per cell for signaling proteins, to millions of molecules for structural proteins. When addressing fundamental questions related to protein evolution, translation and folding, but also in routine laboratory work, a simple rough estimate of the average wild type abundance of each detectable protein in an organism is often desirable. Here, we introduce a meta-resource dedicated to integrating information on absolute protein abundance levels; we place particular emphasis on deep coverage, consistent post-processing and comparability across different organisms. Publicly available experimental data are mapped onto a common namespace and, in the case of tandem mass spectrometry data, re-processed using a standardized spectral counting pipeline. By aggregating and averaging over the various samples, conditions and cell-types, the resulting integrated data set achieves increased coverage and a high dynamic range. We score and rank each contributing, individual data set by assessing its consistency against externally provided protein-network information, and demonstrate that our weighted integration exhibits more consistency than the data sets individually. The current PaxDb-release 2.1 (at http://pax-db.org/) presents whole-organism data as well as tissue-resolved data, and covers 85,000 proteins in 12 model organisms. All values can be seamlessly compared across organisms via pre-computed orthology relationships.},

	abstract = {The amino acid composition of more than 20 enzymes and protein from various closely related mesophilic and thermophilic micro-organisms (esp. Bacillus) have been used to calculate a variety of macroscopic parameters. These included the hydrophobic index (H phi ), the ratio of polar to non-polar volumes (rho), the ratios of Arg/(Arg + Lys), and (Arg + Lys) or (Glx + Asx) to total amino acids, \% H-bonding amino acids, \% alpha-helix- or beta-sheet-forming amino acids, the theoretical melting temperature (TCalcm), the total volume to total amino acid ratio (VR), and the \% non-polar residues (NPS). In contrast to previous similar comparisons with proteins from divergent sources, it was found that thermophilic vs mesophilic proteins from the same genus show correlations between thermostability and increased H phi, decreased rho, and increased Arg/(Arg + Lys), as well as increased alpha-index and beta-index. Weaker correlations were seen for VR, TCalcm, aliphatic index, and NPS, all derived from, or related to, H phi. No correlations existed for the other calculated parameters. These results are consistent with recent results of Argos et al. (1979) [Biochemistry 18, 5698-5703] on sequence analyses of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenases, where thermophilic proteins showed multiple amino acid replacements that caused increased internal hydrophobicity and increased external polarity.

Comparison of tertiary structural properties of several protein families with members of different thermostability should help to delineate the role of individual factors in achieving stability at high temperature. In this work, 16 protein families with at least one known thermophilic and one known mesophilic tertiary structure were examined for the number and type of hydrogen bonds and salt links, polar surface composition, internal cavities and packing densities, and secondary structural composition. The results show a consistent increase in the number of hydrogen bonds and in polar surface area fraction with increased thermostability.},

	abstract = {Within the past two decades, the biological application of mass spectrometric technology has seen great advances in terms of innovations in hardware, software, and reagents. Concurrently, the burgeoning field of proteomics has followed closely (Yates et al., Annu Rev Biomed Eng 11:49-79, 2009)-and with it, importantly, the ability to globally assay altered levels of posttranslational modifications in response to a variety of stimuli. Though many posttranslational modifications have been described, a major focus of these efforts has been protein-level phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Schreiber et al., Proteomics 8:4416-4432, 2008). The desire to examine changes across signal transduction cascades and networks in their entirety using a single mass spectrometric analysis accounts for this push-namely, preservation and enrichment of the transient yet informative phosphoryl side group. Analyzing global changes in phosphorylation allows inferences surrounding cascades/networks as a whole to be made. Towards this same end, much work has explored ways to permit quantitation and combine experimental samples such that more than one replicate or experimental condition can be identically processed and analyzed, cutting down on experimental and instrument variability, in addition to instrument run time. One such technique that has emerged is metabolic labeling (Gouw et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 9:11-24, 2010), wherein biological samples are labeled in living cells with nonradioactive heavy isotopes such as (15)N or (13)C. Since metabolic labeling in living organisms allows one to combine the material to be processed at the earliest possible step, before the tissue is homogenized, it provides a unique and excellent method for comparing experimental samples in a high-throughput, reproducible fashion with minimal technical variability. This chapter describes a pipeline used for labeling living Arabidopsis thaliana plants with nitrogen-15 ((15)N) and how this can be used, in conjunction with a technique for enrichment of phosphorylated peptides (phosphopeptides), to determine changes in A. thaliana's phosphoproteome on an untargeted, global scale.},

In particular, our model predicts ΔH(T), ΔS(T), ΔCp, and ΔF(T) —the folding enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and free energy—as functions of temperature T; the denaturant m values in guanidine and urea; the pH-temperature-salt phase diagrams, and the energy of confinement F(s) of the protein inside a cavity of radius s. All combinations of these phase equilibria can also then be computed from that information. As one illustration, we compute the pH and salt conditions that would denature a protein inside a small confined cavity. Because the model is analytical, it is computationally efficient enough that it could be used to automatically annotate whole proteomes with protein stability information.},

	abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures.},

	abstract = {Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in nature. It is found in all eukaryotes and plays a fundamental role in many diverse and dynamic cellular processes. Also, actin is one of the most ubiquitous proteins because actin?like proteins have recently been identified in bacteria. Actin filament (F?actin) is a highly dynamic structure that can exist in different conformational states, and transitions between these states may be important in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. These transitions can be modulated by various factors causing the stabilization or destabilization of actin filaments. In this review, we look at actin stabilization and destabilization as expressed by changes in the thermal stability of actin; specifically, we summarize and analyze the existing data on the thermal unfolding of actin as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. We also analyze in?vitro data on the heat?induced aggregation of actin, the process that normally accompanies actin thermal denaturation. In this respect, we focus on the effects of small heat shock proteins, which can prevent the aggregation of thermally denatured actin with no effect on actin thermal unfolding. As a result, we have proposed a mechanism describing the thermal denaturation and aggregation of F?actin. This mechanism explains some of the special features of the thermal unfolding of actin filaments, including the effects of their stabilization and destabilization; it can also explain how small heat shock proteins protect the actin cytoskeleton from damage caused by the accumulation of large insoluble aggregates under heat shock conditions.},

Here we show that living epidermal root cells of Arabidopsis thaliana could cope with short-term heat shock stress showing disruption and subsequent recovery of microtubules and actin microfilaments in a time-dependent manner. Time-lapse imaging revealed a very dynamic behavior of both cytoskeletal elements including transient depolymerization and disassembly upon heat shock (40–41 °C) followed by full recovery at room temperature (20 °C) within 1–3 h. Reaction of microtubules, but not actin filaments, to heat shock was dependent on cell type and developmental stage. On the other hand, recovery of actin filaments, but not microtubules, from heat shock stress was dependent on the same parameters. The relevance of this adaptive cytoskeletal behavior to intracellular signalling is discussed.},

Many of the processes in living cells are mediated by protein complexes that dynamically assemble and dissociate depending on cellular needs. Tan et al. developed a method called thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) to monitor the dynamics of native protein complexes inside cells (see the Perspective by Li et al.). The method is based on the idea that proteins within a complex will coaggregate upon heat denaturation. It uses a previously described cellular shift assay to determine melting curves for thousands of proteins and assigns a TPCA signature on the basis of similarity between the curves. The method was validated by detection of many known protein complexes. It identified cell-specific interactions in six cell lines, highlighting the potential for identifying protein complexes that are modulated by disease.
Science, this issue p. 1170; see also p. 1105
Proteins differentially interact with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of protein complex dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated protein-protein interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human protein complexes. Using TPCA, we identified many complexes without detectable differential protein expression, including chromatin-associated complexes, modulated in S phase of the cell cycle. Comparison of six cell lines by TPCA revealed cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. TPCA constitutes an approach for system-wide studies of protein complexes in nonengineered cells and tissues and might be used to identify protein complexes that are modulated in diseases.
A readily deployable approach for system-wide intracellular studies of protein complex dynamics in nonengineered cells and tissues is discussed.

Depending on the CO2 concentration, Pn decreased when temperatures exceeded 35–40°C. This response was inconsistent with the response predicted from the properties of fully activated Rubisco. Rubisco deactivated in leaves when temperature was increased and also in response to high CO2 or low O2. The decrease in Rubisco activation occurred when leaf temperatures exceeded 35°C, whereas the activities of isolated activase and Rubisco were highest at 42°C and {\textgreater}50°C, respectively. In the absence of activase, isolated Rubisco deactivated under catalytic conditions and the rate of deactivation increased with temperature but not with CO2. The ability of activase to maintain or promote Rubisco activation in vitro also decreased with temperature but was not affected by CO2. Increasing the activase/Rubisco ratio reduced Rubisco deactivation at higher temperatures. The results indicate that, as temperature increases, the rate of Rubisco deactivation exceeds the capacity of activase to promote activation. The decrease in Rubisco activation that occurred in leaves at high CO2 was not caused by a faster rate of deactivation, but by reduced activase activity possibly in response to unfavorable ATP/ADP ratios. When adjustments were made for changes in activation state, the kinetic properties of Rubisco predicted the response of Pn at high temperature and CO2.},

	abstract = {Inhibition of net photosynthesis (Pn) by moderate heat stress has been attributed to an inability of Rubisco activase to maintain Rubisco in an active form. To examine this proposal, the temperature response of Pn, Rubisco activation, chlorophyll fluorescence, and the activities of Rubisco and Rubisco activase were examined in species from contrasting environments. The temperature optimum of Rubisco activation was 10°C higher in the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) compared with the Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica), resembling the temperature response of Pn. Pn increased markedly with increasing internal CO2 concentration in Antarctic hairgrass and creosote bush plants subjected to moderate heat stress even under nonphotorespiratory conditions. Nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, the effective quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion (ΔF/Fm′) and the maximum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) were more sensitive to temperature in Antarctic hairgrass and two other species endemic to cold regions (i.e. Lysipomia pumila and spinach [Spinacea oleracea]) compared with creosote bush and three species (i.e. jojoba [Simmondsia chinensis], tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum], and cotton [Gossypium hirsutum]) from warm regions. The temperature response of activity and the rate of catalytic inactivation of Rubisco from creosote bush and Antarctic hairgrass were similar, whereas the optimum for ATP hydrolysis and Rubisco activation by recombinant creosote bush, cotton, and tobacco activase was 8°C to 10°C higher than for Antarctic hairgrass and spinach activase. These results support a role for activase in limiting photosynthesis at high temperature.},
