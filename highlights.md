## In Brief

Thermal profiles and melting temperatures have been modeled for over 1700
proteins from the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* using six biological
replicates, providing a solid groundwork for future thermal shift studies in
the species. Highly significant global correlations were found between melting
temperature and a number of protein characteristics, including molecular
weight, secondary structure content, and hydrophobic and charged accessible
surface areas.

## Highlights

* Over 1700 Arabidopsis proteins with thermal models in multiple replicates

* Melting temperature correlates with 1°, 2°, and 3° protein characteristics

* Ligand-induced thermal shifts are evident in complex protein extracts
